        My name is Punit Singh, and I am currently living in Brampton, Canada. I came here in April of this year as a student, 
        enrolled in the Interactive Media Design course. I am excited to learn about web development and pursue my interests in 
        photography. Although I have limited knowledge in HTML and CSS, I am eager to expand my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a strong interest in designing websites and would like to pursue a career in web development or photography and 
        editing. I am here to learn something new and make a better life for myself.
